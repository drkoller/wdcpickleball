<h2>Ladder Leagues</h2>
  
DC Pickleball League is offering our next multi-week ladder leagues beginning June 23 (Monday league at Catholic Univ.), June 24 (Tuesday league at WTEF), and June 25 (Wednesday league at Catholic Univ.).
For more information, contact us at <a href=mailto:dcpickleballleague@gmail.com>dcpickleballleague@gmail.com</a>,
or register using the links at the top of this page.</a>
<p>
<a href="players.jpg"><img src="players.jpg" width="30%" alt="DC Pickleball League Players" align="left" border="0" style="margin: 0px 20px 15px 0px" /></a>
Our shootout ladder leagues are designed for you to play multiple games
with players of similar skill level in a fun and competitive environment
while climbing up the ladder as you improve across the season!
<p>
We offer both "Social" leagues and "Competitive" leagues according to your
interests. The Social leagues are intended for advanced beginners and low intermediate
players (2.5-3.3 skill level) and consist of a one hour "shootout" round-robin
session amongst 4-5 players, plus 30 minutes of open play each week. The
Competitive leagues are for intermediate and advanced players (3.4-5.0+ skill level) and
consist of a two-hour, double round-robin format plus 45 minutes of open
play each week.
<p>
Ladder league rankings are updated each week based on your performance in
the round-robin events. As you play each week, your ladder ranking will become
more accurate, and your matches more competitive.
<p>
While our leagues focus on doubles pickleball play, you do not need a
partner, and there is no need for a substitute if you miss a week! One of
the benefits of our shootout ladder league format is that players can miss
a week and not be punished in their ladder ranking -- not that anyone would
miss a week of fun, right?

<h2>Lessons & Clinics</h2>

<a href="steve-teach.jpg"><img src="steve-teach.jpg" width="30%" alt="Steve Valiant teaching pickleball" align="left" border="0" style="margin: 0px 20px 15px 0px" /></a>

Whether you are a beginner, intermediate, or advanced amateur player, we offer lessons and clinics tailored to your skill level and needs.
Our lessons and clinics are taught by our Certified Coach Steve Valiant. Steve
has been playing in pickleball tournaments and winning medals across the U.S. for more than 10 years. He has helped hundreds of beginners and more advanced
players to play effectively in recreational and tournament play. His knowledge, patience, and encouragement will help you to improve your game.
<p>
Introductory and intermediate-level classes and clinics are offered at
several outdoor DC courts, weather permitting. Private and semi-private lessons are also available throughout the week.
To sign up for any of these offerings, please email <a href="mailto:wdcpickleball@gmail.com">wdcpickleball@gmail.com</a>. Steve and his colleague Maya Ben-David will schedule 
you for one of the upcoming sessions or arrange a convenient lesson time. Bring your paddle, if you have one,
or borrow one from us for the lesson!
<p>
<b>We hope to see you on the pickleball court!</b>
