<h2>Instructions for removing computer from Pickleball Cannon</h2>

<ol>
<li> Remove the ball machine cover.
<li> <a href="Cannon-vid2.mp4">(Video)</a> With the cover off you have access to the connectors. There is a tab that you squeeze on the connector to remove them. As you take them off, label them with tape so you know where to put them back.
<li> <a href="Cannon-vid3.mp4">(Video)</a> More connector removal.
<li> <a href="Cannon-vid4.mp4">(Video)</a> Take a photo of this connector before you remove it so that you know its orientation to reinstall.
<li> <a href="Cannon-vid5.mp4">(Video)</a> There is a single nut on the bottom of the control panel bracket that needs to come off. It is a bit awkward. Be careful not to damage anything when removing it. If you have an extension, socket and knuckle it makes it easier.
<li> <a href="Cannon-vid6.mp4">(Video)</a> The computer will now lift off easily.
<li> <a href="Cannon-vid7.mp4">(Video)</a> When we return the board it will have a new power switch as demonstrated.
<li> <a href="Cannon-vid8.mp4">(Video)</a> We will return the computer with a template. You will need to drill the cover so that you acess to the new switch. Do you have access to drill bits, likely around 3/4" to 1"?
